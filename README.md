# About the game
Boggle is one of the most popular word search games.  The rules are simple. You have to find as many words as possible on the grid. You can move from one letter (dice) to another if it is a neighbour (in all directions). You cannot use a letter (dice) more than once in a word. You get points for each word - the more letters the better. The puzzle is solved when you collect 30%, 60% or 90% of the total possible points depending on the difficulty.
